# Recommendations with IBM
The goal of the project is to  analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and create a recommendation's system make to suggest them about new articles they will like. 

## Project Components ##

1. and user-item-interactions.csv : tracking of the user item interactions

## Instructions on how to use the code: ## 
In the IPython Notebook, the project is explained step by step. The idea is to create a recommendation system using user similarity to suggest articles. 
In addition, I have also used SVD to create an additional recommendation system.
